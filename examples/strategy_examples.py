OpenAlgo Strategy Module Examples

Two separate surfaces reach OpenAlgo's /strategy module, and they need
different credentials:

  api(api_key=...)  - the API-key surface under /api/v1/strategy/. Lifecycle
                      plus reads: list, status, start, stop, close_all,
                      close_leg, runs, orders, events. Nothing here can create
                      a strategy, edit it, enable live trading, rotate a token
                      or delete anything; building a strategy stays in the
                      browser wizard at /strategy.

  Strategy(...)     - the public webhook at /strategy/webhook/<token>, which is
                      what TradingView and other alert senders post to. It is
                      not under /api/v1 and takes no API key: the token in the
                      URL is the whole credential.

Two strategy kinds, and each refuses the other's vocabulary:

  batch  - a multi-leg spread entered and exited as a unit. start / stop.
  signal - one alert moves one leg. long_entry / long_exit / short_entry /
           short_exit. There is no start and no mode: the first signal after
           the platform session boundary opens the run.
