# OpenAlgo Python SDK

Python client library (`pip install openalgo`) for OpenAlgo's trading platform.
It wraps the OpenAlgo REST API, the WebSocket market-data feed, and ships a
technical-indicator library powered by a Rust core (`openalgo._oaindicators`).

- Requires Python >= 3.12.
- Runtime deps: `httpx`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `websocket-client`. The indicators are
  built into the package (Rust/PyO3); there is no optional extra and no numba.
- The SDK talks to a running OpenAlgo server (default REST `http://127.0.0.1:5000`,
  WebSocket proxy `ws://127.0.0.1:8765`). It is a client only; it does not run a
  server itself.

## Architecture

The public entry point is `openalgo.api`, which composes every REST mixin via
multiple inheritance and calls `BaseAPI.__init__` once:

    api(OrderAPI, GTTAPI, DataAPI, AccountAPI, FeedAPI, OptionsAPI,
        StrategyAPI, TelegramAPI, WhatsAppAPI, UtilitiesAPI)

`Strategy` (the strategy module's public webhook sender) and `ta` (indicators) are
separate top-level exports.

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `openalgo/base.py` | `BaseAPI`: holds config and the shared pooled `httpx.Client` (`self.client`), the shared `_post()` request helper, plus `close()` / context-manager support |
| `openalgo/orders.py` | place / modify / cancel / smart / basket / split orders, order status, positions |
| `openalgo/gtt.py` | `GTTAPI`: `placegttorder` / `modifygttorder` / `cancelgttorder` / `gttorderbook` (SINGLE and OCO triggers) |
| `openalgo/data.py` | quotes, depth, history, intervals, symbol/instrument lookups (returns pandas where relevant) |
| `openalgo/account.py` | funds, holdings, orderbook, tradebook, positionbook, margin, `analyzerstatus` / `analyzertoggle` |
| `openalgo/options.py` | option-chain and options order helpers |
| `openalgo/telegram.py`, `openalgo/whatsapp.py` | notification endpoints |
| `openalgo/utilities.py` | market holidays / timings |
| `openalgo/strategy.py` | `Strategy`: standalone webhook poster for `/strategy/webhook/<token>` (own pooled client) |
| `openalgo/strategy_api.py` | `StrategyAPI`: the API-key surface under `/api/v1/strategy/` (list, status, start, stop, close_all, close_leg, runs, orders, events) |
| `openalgo/feed.py` | `FeedAPI`: WebSocket market-data feed (uses `websocket-client`, not httpx) |
| `openalgo/indicators/` | `ta` technical indicators (Rust core via `_oaindicators`) |

## HTTP layer (connection pooling)

All REST calls go through the single `httpx.Client` created in `BaseAPI.__init__`
and reused via `self.client.post(...)` / `self.client.get(...)`. Do NOT reintroduce
module-level `httpx.post` / `httpx.get` — that opens and tears down a fresh TCP
connection per call, which over a trading session leaves thousands of sockets in
TIME_WAIT and exhausts ephemeral ports. The client mirrors the server's own pooling
in `utils/httpx_client.py`.

Keep-alive reuse only happens when the server supports it. Production OpenAlgo runs
under gunicorn+eventlet (keep-alive supported). The local Werkzeug dev server sends
`Connection: close`, so connections cannot be pooled in local dev even though the
client is correct.

## WebSocket feed

`FeedAPI.connect()` opens one WebSocket and authenticates. `subscribe_ltp` /
`subscribe_quote` / `subscribe_depth` accept `[{"exchange", "symbol"}]` and an
optional callback; polled snapshots are available via `get_ltp` / `get_quotes` /
`get_depth`. Auto-reconnect (on by default) replays active subscriptions after a
drop; `ping_interval`/`ping_timeout` guard against zombie sockets.

## Analyzer (sandbox) mode

The server has an analyzer/sandbox mode where orders are simulated instead of being
sent to the broker (orderids look like `SB-...`, responses carry `"mode": "analyze"`).
Check it with `client.analyzerstatus()` and switch with `client.analyzertoggle(True/False)`.
Always confirm analyze mode before placing test orders. Note: simulated MARKET orders
need a live price, so they fail when the market is closed (use LIMIT for testing on
holidays).

## Bumping the version

The version string lives in three files and they must stay in sync:

1. `pyproject.toml`: `version = "x.y.z"` (source of truth: maturin builds the wheel)
2. `setup.py`: `version="x.y.z"` (legacy setuptools metadata, still committed)
3. `openalgo/__init__.py`: `__version__ = "x.y.z"`

`setup.cfg` contains no version, and there is no committed `PKG-INFO`. After bumping,
grep the repo for the old version to confirm nothing was missed:

    Grep pattern "x\.y\.z" across the repo

Add the release notes to `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` at the top.

Commit message convention (see git log): `vX.Y.Z: short summary`.

## Releasing to PyPI

Do not upload from a developer machine. `.github/workflows/CI.yml` builds abi3 wheels
for five targets (linux x86_64 + aarch64, macOS x86_64 + arm64, windows x86_64) plus
an sdist, and publishes them on a `v*` tag push through PyPI trusted publishing (OIDC,
no API token). A local `maturin publish` would upload one platform's wheel, and the
version number cannot be reused afterwards, so macOS and Linux users would be left
compiling the Rust core from the sdist.

    git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z

## Running / testing locally

- Live tests need a running OpenAlgo server on `:5000` (and the WS proxy on `:8765`)
  plus a valid API key. Do not hardcode API keys in committed files.
- Importing `openalgo` triggers a Numba warmup in `openalgo/indicators/__init__.py`.
  On Python 3.14 with NumPy 2.x there is a Numba incompatibility (`np.trapz` was
  removed). To import the SDK for REST/WebSocket testing without the indicators JIT,
  run with `NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1`.
