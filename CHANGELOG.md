## [2.0.5] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

#### NaN handling in the indicator kernels ([#2029])

Chaining one indicator into another silently produced nothing. Every indicator
emits warm-up NaNs, and the moving-average kernels let a single NaN into their
running accumulator, which stayed poisoned for the rest of the series:

```python
df["RSI_wma"] = ta.rsi(ta.wma(df["close"], 55), 14)
df["RSI_avg"] = ta.wma(df["RSI_wma"], 9)             # was: NaN on every row
ta.crossover(df["RSI_wma"], df["RSI_avg"]).sum()     # was: 0 across 1600 bars
```

`ta.crossover` / `ta.crossunder` were never at fault and are unchanged. Affected
kernels: `sma`, `wma`, `ema`, `hma`, `zlema`, `t3`, `vwma`, `stdev`,
`rolling_sum`, `rolling_variance`, `ema_sma`, `ema_wilder`, `ema_first_valid`,
`true_range`, `atr_wilder` and the rolling extremes behind `stochastic`,
`williams_r`, `aroon`, `donchian`, `midprice` and `midpoint`.

Three failed silently, returning plausible numbers instead of NaN:

- **`stdev` returned `0.0`** for the rest of the series after a NaN rather than
  NaN, because `f64::max` returns the *other* operand when one side is NaN and
  `(NaN).max(0.0).sqrt()` is `0.0`. Bollinger width collapsed to zero instead of
  failing visibly.
- **`rsi` returned a flat `100`** across an upstream indicator's warm-up. A NaN
  delta is neither `> 0` nor `< 0`, so `avg_gain` and `avg_loss` both seeded to 0
  and the `avg_loss == 0` branch published 100. This one predates the Rust core,
  which is why pinning back to 1.0.50 did not help.
- **`median` panicked** through the PyO3 boundary (`partial_cmp().unwrap()`) on
  any window containing a NaN - a `PanicException`, which is a `BaseException`
  and so escapes a normal `except Exception`.

`ta.vi` and `ta.ulcerindex` returned all-NaN even on clean OHLCV; both now match
their textbook definitions.

### Changed

#### The NaN contract is now stated and enforced

Previously unstated, and the two backends had silently drifted apart, so the same
script gave different answers from a wheel and from a source checkout:

- **Rolling-window kernels are window-local.** `out[i]` is NaN iff `i < period-1`
  or the window `[i-period+1 .. i]` contains a NaN; the series recovers as soon as
  the NaN slides out. This is the same rule as pandas `.rolling(period)`.
- **Recursive kernels (the EMA family) skip leading NaNs**, seed at the first
  finite value, and carry their state across an interior NaN.

The Rust core and the pure-NumPy fallback are now checked against each other, and
against pandas, in `benchmark/ci_smoke.py` on every CI run. The Rust core carries
13 new unit tests for the contract.

**For NaN-free input every other indicator is unchanged, bit for bit** - verified
across 155 output series against 2.0.4. Performance is at or better than 2.0.4 for
the hot kernels on 2M rows (`sma` 3.36 -> 2.43 ms, `wma` 3.38 -> 2.62 ms,
`stdev` 3.53 -> 2.96 ms, `atr` 9.30 -> 8.87 ms); `vwma` is the one regression,
2.31 -> 3.20 ms.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-09-08

### New Features

#### GTT (Good Till Triggered) Orders
- **`placegttorder(...)`**: Place a SINGLE or OCO price trigger that sits with
  the broker until LTP crosses the level, then places the underlying order.
  SINGLE takes exactly one of `triggerprice_sl` / `triggerprice_tg`; OCO takes
  all four of `triggerprice_sl`, `stoploss`, `triggerprice_tg` and `target`,
  with the stoploss trigger below the target trigger.
- **`modifygttorder(...)`**: Replace an active trigger's spec. Modify is a full
  replacement, not a patch, so every field to keep must be sent again.
- **`cancelgttorder(trigger_id=...)`**: Cancel an active trigger. Cancelling an
  OCO removes both legs atomically.
- **`gttorderbook()`**: List active triggers. Triggered, cancelled, expired and
  rejected GTTs are filtered out at the broker layer.
- Trigger specs are validated locally before a request leaves the machine: a
  SINGLE with no trigger or with both, an OCO missing a field or with its
  stoploss trigger at or above its target trigger, and an unknown
  `trigger_type` all return `{'status': 'error', 'error_type':
  'validation_error'}` rather than reaching the broker.
- GTT numeric fields are sent as JSON numbers, not strings, matching what the
  server validates. GTT accepts CNC and NRML only; MIS is refused server-side.

#### Strategy Module API (API-key surface)
Nine methods against `/api/v1/strategy/`, for the multi-leg options strategy
engine with end-to-end risk management:
- **`strategylist(status=None, q=None)`**: Strategies this key owns, newest first.
- **`strategystatus(strategy_id=...)`**: One strategy's full config including
  legs, plus its current run or `null`.
- **`strategystart(strategy_id=..., mode=...)`**: Start a batch strategy. `mode`
  is a required keyword argument with no default, in the SDK as on the server:
  omitting it is a `TypeError`, never a live order. The value is passed through
  unnormalised, so a near miss such as `"LIVE"` is refused rather than quietly
  read as sandbox.
- **`strategystop(strategy_id=...)`**: Exit every owned position at market. Read
  `stop_pending` and the per-leg outcomes; an accepted stop is not proof of
  flatness.
- **`strategycloseall(strategy_id=...)`**: Same stop mechanics, plus a
  `close_all_manual` audit event proving an operator asked for the flatten.
- **`strategycloseleg(strategy_id=..., leg_id=...)`**: Exit one leg; the run
  continues with the rest.
- **`strategyruns(strategy_id=..., limit=None)`**: Run history, newest first.
- **`strategyorders(strategy_id=..., run_id=None)`**: Order history, oldest
  first, so an entry always precedes its exit.
- **`strategyevents(strategy_id=..., run_id=None, kind=None, severity=None, limit=None)`**:
  The append-only risk-event audit trail, newest first.

#### Strategy Webhook Client Revamped
`Strategy` now speaks the strategy module's webhook protocol:
- **Batch**: `start(mode)` and `stop()`. `mode` is a required positional
  argument with no default.
- **Signal**: `long_entry()`, `long_exit()`, `short_entry()`, `short_exit()`,
  each naming the leg by `leg_id` or by `symbol` plus `exchange`, and a generic
  `signal(action, ...)` plus a raw `send(payload)`.
- **`webhook_token` constructor keyword** alongside the original `webhook_id`,
  which still works. A missing token is a `ValueError` at construction.
- **The token is never rendered.** `repr()` redacts it, because the token is the
  whole credential and anywhere it is written down is a second copy of it.
- **Every documented outcome is returned, not raised.** A 200
  `rejected_dedupe`, a 409 `rejected_cooling_off` and a 403
  `rejected_live_disabled` all come back as dicts carrying their `result` label
  and the HTTP `code`, because that label is the contract. Only a transport
  failure or a non-JSON answer produces a locally-built error dict.

### Breaking Changes

- **`Strategy.strategyorder(symbol, action, position_size)` was removed.** The
  webhook it posted to no longer exists. It now raises `NotImplementedError`
  naming the replacements rather than failing at the network. There is no
  automatic mapping: `BUY` is `long_entry` on a flat leg and `short_exit` on a
  short one, and guessing which would be guessing at an order. Use
  `start(mode)` / `stop()` for a batch strategy, or `long_entry()` /
  `long_exit()` / `short_entry()` / `short_exit()` for a signal strategy.

### Internal

- **`BaseAPI._post(endpoint, payload)`**: one shared pooled-client request
  helper for the new surfaces. Unlike the older per-mixin `_make_request`, a
  non-200 answer with a JSON body is returned as-is with `code` attached
  instead of being flattened into an `HTTP 409: {...}` string - the strategy
  and GTT surfaces put the actionable detail inside that body (a 409 stop
  carries `stop_pending` and the per-leg outcomes, a 400 carries a `message`
  object keyed by field name). Existing methods are untouched.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-07-15

### New Features

#### WebSocket Feed API - Real-Time Order Updates
- **`subscribe_orders(on_order_update=None)`**: Account-level real-time order
  status stream over the existing OpenAlgo WebSocket connection — fills,
  partial fills, rejections and cancellations pushed by the broker (live
  mode) or the sandbox engine (analyze mode), for orders from any origin
  (API, broker app/web, engine square-offs).
- **`unsubscribe_orders()`**: Stop the order-update stream.
- **`get_orders()`**: Cached order updates received so far (most recent
  first, capped at 500).
- **`[ORDER]` log category**: order updates printed at `verbose=2`.
- Order-update subscription survives reconnects — replayed automatically
  after re-authentication, like market-data subscriptions.
- Message fields use OpenAlgo common order constants (`symbol` in OpenAlgo
  format, `action`, `pricetype`, `product`, lowercase `order_status`,
  `rejection_reason` with the broker's full RMS/OMS text).
- Requires an OpenAlgo server with order-update streaming (the
  `subscribe_orders` WebSocket action).

## [1.0.40] - 2025-11-25

### New Features

#### WebSocket Feed API - Verbose Control
- **`verbose` parameter**: Added verbosity control for WebSocket feed operations (LTP, Quote, Depth)
  - `verbose=False` (default): Silent mode - no SDK output, only errors
  - `verbose=True` or `1`: Basic info - connection, auth, subscription status
  - `verbose=2`: Full debug - all market data updates from SDK
- **Cleaner output format**: Aligned log categories `[WS]`, `[AUTH]`, `[SUB]`, `[LTP]`, `[QUOTE]`, `[DEPTH]`, `[ERROR]`
- **Trader-friendly logging**: Concise, aligned output for easy troubleshooting

### Usage Example
```python
from openalgo import api

# Silent mode (default) - no SDK output
client = api(api_key="...", host="...", ws_url="...", verbose=False)

# Basic logging - connection/subscription info
client = api(api_key="...", host="...", ws_url="...", verbose=True)

# Full debug - all data updates
client = api(api_key="...", host="...", ws_url="...", verbose=2)
```

### Output Format (verbose=True)
```
[WS]    Connected to ws://127.0.0.1:8765
[AUTH]  Success | Broker: upstox | User: rajandran
[SUB]   NSE_INDEX:NIFTY | Mode: Quote | Status: success
```

# Filter by exchange from combined data
nse_only = all_instruments[all_instruments['exchange'] == 'NSE']
nfo_options = all_instruments[
    (all_instruments['exchange'] == 'NFO') &
    (all_instruments['instrumenttype'].isin(['CE', 'PE']))
]

# Download specific exchange (still supported)
nse_df = client.instruments(exchange="NSE")
nfo_df = client.instruments(exchange="NFO")

# Filter and analyze
equities = nse_df[nse_df['instrumenttype'] == 'EQ']
df.to_csv('nse_instruments.csv', index=False)
