OpenAlgo REST API Documentation - Strategy Module Methods
    https://docs.openalgo.in

The API-key surface for OpenAlgo's ``/strategy`` module: multi-leg options
strategies with end-to-end risk management, plus the signal-driven mode that
reacts to individual alerts.

It is lifecycle plus reads only. Building a strategy stays in the browser
wizard at ``/strategy``; nothing here can create a strategy, edit its
configuration, enable live trading, rotate a webhook token or delete anything.

Five rules worth knowing before calling anything in this module:

1. ``mode`` on :meth:`StrategyAPI.strategystart` is required and is never
   defaulted, here or on the server. It is a keyword argument with no default,
   so omitting it is a TypeError rather than a live order.
2. Live is opt-in per strategy. A strategy is created sandbox-only and
   ``mode="live"`` is refused with a 409 until the operator enables live
   trading on the strategy page.
3. A strategy that is not yours answers 404, identical to one that does not
   exist, so the id space cannot be probed.
4. An accepted stop is not proof of flatness. Read ``stop_pending`` and the
   per-leg outcomes; a 200 with ``stop_pending: true`` means the exits were
   accepted and are still working.
5. No endpoint returns a webhook token. Only its SHA-256 digest is stored, and
   the plaintext is shown once in the browser at creation and rotation.

        - A run whose entries were all rejected is closed immediately and the

        Notes:
        - ``run_stopped`` reports only what this call could prove. A live broker
          normally acknowledges before its fill, so even the last accepted exit
          returns false and the fill finalises the run later.
        - A refused exit is a failure, not a close: read the per-leg ``ok``.
          The leg stays retryable, so its stop, its target and the scheduler's
          square-off can all still reach it.
        - A leg_id that names no open leg is a 409, not a 404. The strategy was

        - order_ack_unrecorded (critical): the broker accepted an order but its
          acknowledgement could not be written; it reconciles itself.

          leg asked for, so a nearer one was used.
