OpenAlgo Strategy Webhook Module
    https://docs.openalgo.in

Posts to the public webhook at ``/strategy/webhook/<token>``, the surface
TradingView and any other alert sender reaches. It is not under ``/api/v1`` and
takes no API key: the token in the URL is the whole of the credential, so treat
it the way you would treat a password.

The token is shown exactly once, in the browser, when the strategy is created or
when the token is rotated. No endpoint returns it - only its SHA-256 digest is
stored - so if it is lost, rotate it on the strategy page and copy the new one.

Two vocabularies, and each strategy kind refuses the other's:

- batch: ``start`` (which requires ``mode``) and ``stop``. A multi-leg spread
  entered and exited as a unit.
- signal: ``long_entry``, ``long_exit``, ``short_entry`` and ``short_exit``. One
  alert moves one leg. There is no start and no mode: the first signal after the
  platform session boundary opens the run, and the mode comes from the
  strategy's own live opt-in.

            - Being refused is different. A signal blocked by the strategy's

              idempotent by meaning, and a 60 second window would suppress a
              genuine long, short, long sequence.
